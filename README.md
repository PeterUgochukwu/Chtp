#Deitel & Deitel - "Java How To Program" - solutions to exercises

Intro

Here you can find my solutions for Deitel & Deitel - "Java How To Program".

The code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty (correctness, safety, etc).


How to contribute

If you wrote an exercise(s) solution(s) that I haven't done, feel free to send it (them) to me. Please, contact me also if you've found any bug in the sources on the web.

please, test your code before sending it: it must work as expected by exercise question;
don't, I repeat, don't copy and paste from copyrighted material available online;
every solution must be based only on chapter stuff or concepts from previous chapters: not on stuff to be explained yet;
